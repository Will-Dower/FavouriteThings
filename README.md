# FavouriteThings

This app is meant to be a notebook of sorts to hold information about your favourite items, written to test the different components of SwiftUI, Xcode's test-driven development system, and the integration between SwiftUI, UIKit and CoreData. This app should run in iPhone and iPad mode, and will save all data on exit. It's features include modifiable fields and fieldnames, as well as image saving and location saving.
